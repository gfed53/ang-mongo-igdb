# AngMongoIGDB


## About

A MEAN stack app using the [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/api) and possibly the [CheapShark API](http://www.cheapshark.com/api/). Very early stages.

## For the Future...

I may create something similar to my [What to Play](https://github.com/gfed53/ang-game-selector) app, upgrading from Angular 1.x to 2/4/5/Next and using MongoDB with mLab for dynamic data. I plan on making the functionality of the app different from my previous project, while still retaining the same goal of finding recommendations based on user input. Stay tuned!
