# AngMongoIGDB


## About

A MEAN stack app using the [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/api) and possibly the [CheapShark API](http://www.cheapshark.com/api/). Very early stages.

## Project Structure

I have the front and back end isolated in their own directories, `client-main` and `server-main`. As of now, the backend is in a completely different private repo, so note that `server-main` is not being utilized at all at this time. I plan to move the actual backend into server-main in the future when deploying.

## For the Future...

I may create something similar to my [What to Play](https://github.com/gfed53/ang-game-selector) app, upgrading from AngularJS (1.x) to Angular (2+) and using MongoDB with mLab for dynamic data. I plan on making the functionality of the app different from my previous project, while still retaining the same goal of finding recommendations based on user input. Stay tuned!
